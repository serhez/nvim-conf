# conf-nvim

My current `nvim` configuration.

## Acknowledgments

I have been inspired by many open source configs and pieces of code out there in order to develop different parts and features of this config. These incude (but are not limited to):

- [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim).
- [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad).
- EdenEast's [config](https://github.com/EdenEast/nyx/tree/8a9819e4ea11193434b2366b9f1d65ed3a4661f3/config/.config/nvim).
